# Prestige Power

This project was built from Doug's React.js website boilerplate template ([dougs-react-boiler](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)) and was further bootstrapped from [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start` || `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build` || `npm run-script build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.


## Firebase Setup

Firebase is my preferable setup for database, server functions, and SSL hosting, I would highly recommend!

### Create new project @ https://firebase.google.com/

 - Add a web app under Gear > Project Settings > Your Apps, then grab the Config snippet to copy past in our .env file
 - Pick Firestore server location so initialization works
 
### `firebase login`

Prompted for your firebase credentials, input them

### `firebase init`

  1. $ `Proceed?` Yes
  2. Select what you need for your project, but I usually select Firestore, Functions, Hosting, and sometimes Storage
  3. Use Existing project
  4. $ `What file should be used for Firestore Rules?` firestore.rules
  5. $ `What file should be used for Firestore indexes?` firestore.indexes.json
  6. $ `What language would you like to use to write Cloud Functions?` TypeScript 
  7. $ `Do you want to use TSLint to catch probable bugs and enforce style?` Yes
  8. $ `Do you want to install dependencies with npm now?` Yes
  9. $ `What do you want to use as your public directory?` build
  10. $ `Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)?` Yes

Storage setup is just $ `What file should be used for Storage Rules?` storage.rules

### `npm run-script build` then `firebase deploy`

This will build your current setup and deploy everything including Functions, Firestore, Storage, etc rules, and Hosting to Firebase.

### Other commands: 

- View the current Firebase env config variables:
$ `firebase functions:config:get`

- Call those firebase.config() variables:
 $ `functions.config().emails.hello.user`

- Setup multiple projects in the same folder, you can add alias for each project (1 will be default):
 $ `firebase use --add`

- Use firebase commands as normal, but with the `--project=test` suffix: 
 $ `firebase deploy --project=test`
 $ `firebase functions:config:set --project=test emails.hello.user="email@email.com" emails.hello.password="1234password"`

- Deploy only the Functions:
 $ `firebase deploy --only functions`

- Deploy only specific Functions:
 $ `firebase deploy --only functions:func1,functions:func2`

- Deploy only Firestore rules:
 $ `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`

- Deploy only hosting:
 $ `firebase deploy --only hosting`

- Deploy everything with a message:
 $ `firebase deploy -m "Deploying the best new feature ever."`

- Use the --debug command appended to the end to get more info:
 $ `firebase deploy --project=test --debug`
